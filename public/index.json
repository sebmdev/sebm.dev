[{"categories":["backend"],"content":"🧩 Background While working on a feature that involved loading our company’s internal Employee Directory, I noticed something frustrating: every refresh took about 10 seconds — and that was on a fast connection. During debugging, I realized it wasn’t just my local machine struggling. The API was returning roughly 5 MB of data per request, and every load pulled every single employee record with redundant nested information. For users accessing the system from the province, where connectivity can be limited and data costs are higher, this wasn’t just inconvenient — it was unfairly inaccessible. So I decided to do something about it.

Returning large nested JSON structures. Performing no pagination or projection, which meant unnecessary network load. Forcing the frontend to render huge payloads before showing anything. In short, it was a case of over-fetching meets under-optimizing.

Not everyone using your app has fiber internet or unlimited data. Sometimes, shaving off a few megabytes isn’t just a technical win — it’s a way to make software more inclusive.
